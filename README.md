Users can arrange tickets by status, user, or priority, and sort them by priority or title. The app is designed to be visually appealing and responsive. It also ensures a seamless user experience by saving user preferences, even after a page reload. Developed purely in React JS, this project offers an efficient way to manage and visualize tasks.
